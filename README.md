# Learning-Git-Branches

A comprehensive demonstration of Git branching workflow and collaborative development practices.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a practical example of:
- Creating and managing feature branches
- Writing meaningful commit messages
- Using pull requests for code review
- Maintaining clean project history
- Collaborative development best practices

## 📁 Project Structure
```
Learning-Git-Branches/
├── README.md           # Main project documentation
├── project-info.md     # Detailed project information
├── src/               # Source code directory
│   └── main.py        # Sample Python application
└── docs/              # Documentation directory
    └── git-workflow.md # Git workflow documentation
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Explore the different files to understand the project structure
3. Read `docs/git-workflow.md` to learn about branching strategies
4. Run the sample application: `python src/main.py`

## 🌟 Key Learning Points
- **Branch Isolation**: Each feature developed in its own branch
- **Code Review**: Pull requests ensure quality and knowledge sharing
- **Safe Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Easy Rollbacks**: Clean history makes debugging and reverting simple
